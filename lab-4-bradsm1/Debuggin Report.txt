Copy Function Debugging Report:
The function had bugs at lines 212, 219.
The bug at 212 was that the copy matrix was not being set to the current size of the matrix being copied.
it instead was defaulting to the 3x3 matrix.
The bug at 219 was that the elements being set were being placed in the wrong location.
The row was being set to the column, and the column was being set to the row.
The proper setting is [row][column], row, column. Not [column][row], column, row.

Thanks.
